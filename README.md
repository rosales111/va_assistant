# Veterans Voice Assistant
A specialized voice assistant built on Raspberry Pi to 
help veterans access healthcare information and resources. 
This project combines natural language processing with 
veterans' healthcare domain knowledge to create an 
accessible interface for common healthcare queries.

Project Overview
The Veterans Voice Assistant is designed to:

Process voice commands with a custom wake word
Handle veterans' healthcare-specific queries
Provide accurate, relevant healthcare information
Operate efficiently on Raspberry Pi 4 hardware

Technical Features

Custom wake word detection
Speech-to-text processing
Natural Language Processing for intent classification
Text-to-speech response generation
Lightweight model deployment for Raspberry Pi

Installation
